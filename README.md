# odin-recipes
My first project in Foundations called Recipes.

This was a fun little project to build out a 
recipes website.  I learned a lot about Git
and Github as I committed often, usually 
after a page was created and linked to 
index.html.  I got practice on trying to write
good commit comments, although I feel there is much
left to be desired on that part.  I will continue to 
improve on this as I get more practice. 

I also got to put into practice all that I have learned 
in Foundations thus far, like, boilerplates,
headings, paragraphs, alternative text, images, links, 
unordered, and ordered lists.

I am enjoying the journey and look forward to more 
challenges ahead.
